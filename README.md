# 🛒 Walmart Sparkathon MVP – Smart Store Layout Optimization

Welcome to our intelligent layout optimization solution designed for Walmart’s next-gen retail experience. This project is our MVP submission for the **Walmart Sparkathon**, focused on delivering **personalized, data-driven store layouts** powered by AI, adaptive learning, and a user-friendly dashboard.

## 🧠 Why Layout Optimization?

Walmart operates thousands of stores across vastly different regions. A single, static layout fails to capture the diverse needs of customers, who vary in:

* 🧍‍♂️ **Demographics and spending power**
* 🌦️ **Climate and seasonal preferences**
* 🛒 **Shopping patterns and cultural habits**

A universal layout **limits accessibility**, reduces customer satisfaction, and restricts the potential for localized sales growth.

## 🚀 Our Solution: AI-Powered Layout Engine + Dynamic Dashboard

We developed a **smart, adaptive layout system** with a fully functional **dashboard interface**. This allows Walmart to **design, simulate, and optimize layouts** specific to each store — from **zones** to **shelves** to **product placement**.

### 🧩 Key Features:

#### 🖥️ 1. Interactive Layout Dashboard

* Input **store dimensions** and desired **zones** (e.g., Electronics, Grocery, Cash Counters).
* AI automatically **positions zones** based on priority, accessibility, and optimization logic.
* Fine-tune **shelf positions** inside each zone.
* Add **products to shelves** and visualize placements.

#### 🤖 2. AI-Driven Placement Engine

* Uses **reinforcement learning** and historical data to optimize:

  * **Zone arrangement** for customer flow
  * **Shelf structures** for accessibility
  * **Product positions** for visibility and purchase likelihood
* Takes into account customer behavior, spending trends, local climate, and more.

#### 🔁 3. Continuous Learning Loop

* AI **learns from performance feedback**:

  * Sales data
  * Customer satisfaction metrics
  * Movement heatmaps (if integrated later)
* Continuously **recommends smarter layouts** and **auto-adapts future arrangements**.

#### 📊 4. Smart Recommendations Engine

* Dashboard displays:

  * Product-level performance
  * Underperforming zones
  * Optimization suggestions for improved revenue and UX

## 📌 Use Case Flow

1. **Store Manager inputs** dimensions + desired zones.
2. **AI generates** an optimized layout in the dashboard.
3. Manager **reviews & customizes** if needed.
4. **Shelves & products** are positioned by AI logic.
5. Over time, AI **learns from store data** and **suggests smarter adjustments**.
